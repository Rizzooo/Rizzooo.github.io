Whew! It was rough but I made it through; barely.

While working on this project, for the first time, I felt like a real programmer and it felt great. Going from a place where I knew little to nothing about coding or what a class method even was to being able to build something like our CLI gems was awesome; but it was TOUGH!

Unfortunately, throughout my time working on the project I was unable to use Slack (my go-to, aside from google, by way of asking for help and/or finding answers). This seemed to make the project 5x harder and had me pulling my hair out during late-night programming sessions, but I found that, in a way, this unfortunate situation forced me to really soak up the articles I read online and previous lessons on Learn.co. Because I knew I had very little / no immediate help, I'd search the internet and read guides and articles for hours, which I believe has only helped my way of thinking when it comes to coding (even though I'd much prefer to never have this happen again).

All in all, working through this CLI data gem was very tough. In fact, I still believe there are some things l need to fix within my gem but the feeling of working with ruby to build something from the ground up was incredibly satisfying, and the feeling when running the program that final time and watching it work just as you'd planned, incomparable! 

As someone who loves to learn and loves that sense of accomplishment when completing something you worked hard on, working on this project was a great experience for me, stressful but well worth the time and effort. I'm actually excited to see what I can build it into if I can keep working on it in the future!
